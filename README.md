##Introduction
This web application was developed as a final project in WHS Intro to CS class.

####Goals
The goal of this project was to create a web version of a deli ticket dispenser system that is used in a classroom setting to 
organize students who need help with their code. A student is be able to take a ticket (digitally) by entering their name. This name is added to a queue and the webpage will display their ticket number and the number that is currently being "served".
Also, this application lets two or more teachers serve the same queue at the same time, which was a problem with the physical version. 

The teacher will have a seperate page that they use for recieving the name (and number) of the student that they can serve. 
There teacher also has the options to view the whole queue, edit the queue, and delete the queue.


####Future Features
Additional features could include... 
* Options for creating a new queue with and a unique generated "sharing" link or pin, so there can be multiple queues for multiple classrooms at the same time.
* Password protection/login for the teacher page, which would include a feature for changing this password
* Improved security of the application, and protection from it being broken can be improved. 

##Try It!
The run this web application you need
- [x] Apache webserver
- [x] MySQL 
- [x] PHP 

The SQL statements needed for setting up the database are in the file `sqlstatements.txt`

This will also run on the xampp distro, which is very friendly for new users. 

Or you can try out the latest version on [cloud9](https://delicountr-ryanmarten.c9users.io/), where I am currently developing.
